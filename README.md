# JarvisLite_ai-project
This code is a voice-activated virtual assistant that uses speech recognition and AI to perform various tasks based on user commands. It listens for voice input, processes the command, and responds accordingly by opening websites, playing songs, retrieving news, or generating responses using the Google Gemini AI model.

Key Features:
Speech Recognition: The program listens for a wake word ("Jarvis") and responds to voice commands.
AI Integration: For text-based commands, the assistant uses Google Gemini API to generate intelligent responses.
Web Automation: It can open popular websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn based on user requests.
Music Playback: It plays songs from a predefined music library.
News Updates: It fetches the latest headlines using the News API.
Text-to-Speech: The assistant speaks responses using high-quality text-to-speech (gTTS) and plays them through the Pygame mixer.
Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling for exceptions during the voice recognition process.
This code allows users to interact with their computer using voice commands, combining AI and automation to streamline tasks
